## Profiles 
- As a site memeber, I want to personalize my calandar both in aesthetics and function. Being able to fill out my name and purpose for the calandar via pre defined text feields and free text field or two 

- I am able to differentiate between calandar types or event types allowing me to separate work/personal life events. Either through separate calandars or through style and colour choices. 

- I am able to send invites for events via email. 

## Calandars  
- As a site users, I can filter by year/month/day which will render a new view of the calandar condensing events into smaller information blocks. I am able to easily navigate between these from the home page. 

- I am able to filter events by their type/description or colour allowing, this will be enabled as a drop down or selection tab that allows me to quickly do so without the need to log into or switch between accounts. 

- I am able to easily open each event without the need to navigate between pages, allowing me to easily view multiple events at a time. 


## Events
- I can set date/time/title/description/type for each event with the option to set a reoccuring event or one off. 

- Events are colour coded and will easily be distinguishable without the need to read the title or description.
